# Lab Notebook

Week of 2/24:

Proposal Review Feedback: 
  - Validation process not well thought out
      -> need to analyze how to ACTUALLY calculate high level functionality
  - Power Subsystem:
      -> 12V-5V drop may draw too much heat and burn parts. Use buck converter to limit power consumption
For breadboard demo...
  - Get imu module working, including calculating threshold for tension

Takeaway from TA meeting:
1. Focus on PCB design without IMU
2. Order Arduino wire and draft any parts we need
3. Look into buck converter
